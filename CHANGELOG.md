# v2.0.1
- Fix warning

# v2.0.0
- TTYString is now a module not a class.
- Address the issue where preserved styles and unknown codes would cause the cursor to be misaligned when moving, and potentially overwriting styles unexpectedly:
  - `clear_style: false` is now `style: TTYString::RENDER`, which modifies styles to display as they would rather than just passing them through them unprocessed
  - `clear_style: true` is now `style: TTYString::DROP` (and still the default)
  - Unknown codes are now dropped by default
  - it's now possible to set `unknown: TTYString::RAISE` to raise on unrecognized CSI codes (`unknown: TTYString::DROP` is the default)
- drop more codes that are known to do nothing for the display of text `\e[?5l`,`\e[?5h`,`\e[?25l`,`\e[?25h`,`\e[?1004l`,`\e[?1004h`,`\e[?1049l`,`\e[?1049h`
